AES version 2.1.0 (Official version)
  Even if the path of the file or the file name is changed due to the 
  specification change of the evaluation target, it can now be executed without problems.
  For that, We have deleted the function to automatically set the path of the file necessary for evaluating.
  It is necessary for the user to specify the path of the file that has been set up so far.
  Main changes from AES version 2.0.0 are as follows
    - AES's run folder path is just under [AUTOSAR_VERSION] folder
      [AUTOSAR_VERSION] folder must follow the following folder structure
        [msn]/[workspace]/[DEVICE_NAME]/[AUTOSAR_VERSION]
            [msn] : Module name as lower case(e.g. dio, mcu, wdg , etc...)
            [workspace] : The folder name is arbitrary
            [DEVICE_NAME] : Device name(e.g. D1M2H, C1H, E2M, etc...)
            [AUTOSAR_VERSION] : AUTOSAR version(4.0.3, 3.2.2, 4_2_2, etc...)
      There is no restriction on folders above [msn]
    - Please set the following path of the file.
        - Generation Tool('Generation Tool' in AES_Config sheet)
        - BSWMDT File('BSWMDT Config File' in AES_Config sheet)
        - GHS Compiler option file('GHS Compiler option file' in AES_Config sheet)
        - GHS Compiler option rule file('GHS Compiler option rule file' in AES_Config sheet)
        - trxml file for AES('Trxml File' in AES_Config sheet)
        - Compiler Include Paths('CC Include Path' in AES_Config sheet)
        - Assembler Include Paths('ASM Include Path' in AES_Config sheet)
      Please see AES User's Manual for details

AES version 1.3.3 (Official version) for Single core/Multi core

  1. AES bug fix as followings.
    (1) Template/Makefile_Template
        - Bug of the message displayed in building.
        - "ASM_INCLUDE_PATH" is not referred in assembling.
          Note : There are possibility that cannot assemble correctly, 
                 because the assembler assembled with the COMPILOER_INCLUDE macro 
                 in Makefile_Template conventionally, however after this version, 
                 will be assembling with the ASSEMBLER_INCLUDE macro.
        - An extra include path is set.
        - Setting the "ASM_FILES_TO_BUILD" in "Driver.mak" is not reflected to 
          other files.
    (2) Tool/EV2Config.py
        - Typo(L.120: "Illeagual" -> "Illegal")
        - An Spec Number check is not implemented
    (3) Tool/group_list.py
        - Typo("Makefile generate_$(MODULE_NAME)" -> 
          "Makefile generate_$(MODULE_NAMES)")
        - Typo("FLASE" -> "FALSE")
        - Typo("\tif " -> "\t@if " (there are some locations, but not at all))
        - Typo("str(row + 2) + 'line.\r\n'" -> "str(row + 2) + ' line.\r\n'")
        - Mistake of target designation at Build.
    (4) Tool/BuildLogCheck.py
        - remove file without closing a file

*** 20-Jun-2016 ***
AES version 1.3.3 (Beta version) for Single core/Multi core

  1. Template/Makefile_Template (Update)
    (1) VariableCheck: Corrective measures against the defect of source file
                       additional settings and the incorporation of exclusive
                       control
        Deleted the setting of AES_Test_Result.c file that was automatically
        added to CC_FILES_TO_BUILD during the VariableCheck evaluation due to
        the conflict with VariableCheck.c.
        Added the processing to delete the setting of AES_Test_Result.c from
        CC_FILES_TO_BUILD when it was registered with CC_FILES_TO_BUILD during
        the VariableCheck evaluation.
 
    (2) VariableCheck: Corrective measures against the inability to delete
                       VariableCheck.c by executing "make clean_all"
        The VariableCheck.c was not registered with GENERATED_SOURCE_FILES (it
        was added to CC_FILES_TO_BUILD).
        Changed the setting for it to be registered with both
        GENERATED_SOURCE_FILES and CC_FILES_TO_BUILD.

    (3) The exit status of errors occurred in the compiler/linker was converted
        to the normal status and passed to Makefile for the build.
        Modified the status of errors to be passed to Makefile for the build as
        is in case of errors.

    (4) Modified for Generation tool of ADC to be selectable.
        It used to be necessary to directly modify Makefile_Template when
        wanting to change the Generation Tool depending on the type of ADC but
        modified for the Generation Tool to be selectable by defining macro in
        the setting file (AES_config.mak).

    (5) Deleted a non-existent path that was set in a part of the include file
        search path information that was set to CC_INCLUDE_PATH.
        [Restrictions]
        Shown below are also non-existent paths but restricted since they are
        defined in ghs_rh850_r4.0.3_defs.mak (common file) and unable to be
        modified.

        .../external/X1x/common_platform/generic/compiler/4.0.3/ghs/include4.0.3
        .../external/X1x/common_platform/generic/compiler/4.0.3/ghs/includecommon

    (6) Modified due to the wrong message output of trxml file check.
        As it was passed to the shell without escaping "*" in the message and
        perceived as a wild card, the list of files in current working directory
        was displayed.
        Modified for every "*" in the message to be escaped (enclosed in single
        quotation marks).


*** 28-Apr-2016 ***
AES version 1.3.2 for Single core/Multi core

  1. AES_Files/Template/Makefile_Template (Update)
    (1) Changed the link directive setting list and moved its definition to
        Module.mak.
    (2) Added the include path for the flash library.
    (3) Changed the positional relationship between the conversion line of
        "MakeAppendix" and the include of Driver.mak.
    (4) Integrated the path settings and the antomatic change items in
        Module.mak.
    (5) Organized unused MACRO definitions and commented-out parts (deleted).
    (6) Simplified some path settings (PROJECT_ROOT) accompanied by a long
        directory path.
        Build log message about include path, etc, will be shortned.
    (7) Changed for errors to be occurred when
        "Test_Application_[MICRO_VARIANT]_aes.trxml" is older than
        "Test_Application_[MICRO_VARIANT].trxml" or it does not exist.

  2. AES_Files/Module.mak (Update)
    (1) Changed the method of setting the stub file.
    (2) Changed the definition of common file (library).
    (3) Moved the setting contents sucn as path settings and aggregated the
        definitions of stub file, library, etc. that are required to be changed
        manually by evaluation environments and modules.

  3. AES_Files/Driver.mak (Update)
    (1) Moved the definition of output file for Generation Tool.
    (2) Deleted the MACRO for renesas_lib... since it was unused.
    (3) Replaced [MSN] shown in each driver source file name with a MACRO and
        eliminated the module dependency. When using files, each file needs to
        be modified depending on used/unused by modules.
        Defined driver types and separately added the settings for Wdg.
  
  4. AES_Files/Compiler_version.mak (Update)
    (1) Removed the latter part from the existing setting contents and left the
        first part as is.  Moved the latter part to AES_config.mak that was
        newly created.

  5. AES_Files/AES_config.mak (Add)
    (1) Is included in Makefile (overall controll) and in Makefile for the build
        (Makefile_Template).
    (2) Kept the settings for the latter part of the existing
        Compiler_version.mak file.

  6. Restrictions
    (1) "VariableCheck" mode is not available.
       * degrade for AES(single core) V1.2.2 (@D1x V406)
       * degrade for AES(multi core) V1.3.1 (@D1x V402)
      (1-1) Link error will be occured, when you select the "VariableCheck" mode
            in Judgment column.
      (1-2) The file VariableCheck.[ch], which is gereraged by "VariableCheck"
            mode, is not removed by "make clean" or "make clean_all" command.
    (2) Behaivor on GenTool error.
       * new for AES(single core)
       * degrade for AES(multi core) V1.3.1 (@D1x V402)
       When generation tool outputs an error, AES continues next compile flow.
    (3) Behaivor on Build error.
       * new for AES(single core)
       * degrade for AES(multi core) V1.3.1 (@D1x V402)
       When compiler/linker stops with an error, AES continues to launch a Multi
       debugger.


*** 10-Nov-2015 ***
AES version 1.3.1 for C1x (multi core)

  1. Corresponding to debugging multi core processor.
    (1) Start up the Debugger for target of multi core processor.
    (2) Function of conversion debug script to python type. (In multi core
        debugger start up with python script.) (#44287) Now, cannot use the "/"
        and "\" in debug script at multi core environment.

 *** Restriction Item. ******************************************************
 * if you want to use character above, described as followings.
 * example
 * "\" --> "\\\\"
 * "/" --> "\\/"
 * But if using "/" in the debug command option, don't
 * modify.
 * example
 * "print /a *ggg" --> "print /a *ggg"
 * If you will use bracket in the script, should be describing in the single
 * line to the closed bracket.
 *****************************************************************************

  2. AES bug fix in the followings.
    (1) When lacking the "Check file" column in Test_Spec.xls at "Source File
        Check", display the error message. But that message include no line
        number. (#44287)
    (2) File name and Line number in displayed error message when the AES cannot
        find the test program, that file name is different with the expected
        one. And different line number from the row number of Excel. (#44287)
    (3) "make clean_all" does not remove the include file.

  3. Enhancement of error processing. (#43934)
    (1) When occur error, AES break the current test item and will carried out
        the next test item without stopping.
    (2) When occur error, AES does not perfrome next step.
        Example: If target build was failed, does not start the debugger.
    (3) Add the new function for confirming the exit status of Generation Tool
        and GNU make in automatically.
        Transformation from value of exit status to the text format and save to
        the log file.

  4. Countermeasure of debugger freeze. (#43934)
    When elapsed time reach to 120 seconds from start of monitoring debugger
    process, debugger process are killed from external.

  5. The bug fix of the result report tool. (#43934)
    If failed creation of the Result.txt of first test item that stop the result
    report tool because error then can not create result report file.

  6. Execute the test item by testID instead of the folder name.
    You can be executing with test ID if invoke the single test. Test ID is
    equal to "Spec Number" column of Test_Spec.xls.
    Example
    (1) make [test ID]
    (2) make [test ID1] [test ID2] [test ID3]

  7. Remove the Interrupt_VectorTable.c path setting from Makefile_Template
    If you use interrupt at test then handled as Test Program or set to
    CC_FILES_TO_BUILD in "Make Appendix" column.

  8. Forcibly set locale to en_US.
